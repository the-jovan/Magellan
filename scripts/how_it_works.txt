The big idea behind how it all works:

<---- mainScript.js ---->
1. on load main page fetches 5 random questions (fetch all, shuffle them, then select first 5)
2. select random answers from array of continents by filtering out the correct one, shuffle
array, pick 2 and then add correct
3. on load, after all that, render first question, rest will be rendered by click event
4. map over remaining 4 questions and render them through Question's method

<---- question.js ---->
5. takes in image link and answers array and renders html part in '.main' container
6. calls function checkAnswer to see if user selected correct option

<---- user.js ---->
7. maps over all 'options' and adds click events to verify the answer
8.1. user clicks on correct answer => answer is green, 750 points are added through Status.correctAnswer(),
and all other click events are removed as the quora of 1 click has been reached
8.2. user clicks on wrong answer => answer is red, correct one is styled green, no points are added, 
and all other click events are removed as the quora of 1 click has been reached

<---- mainScript.js ---->
9. upon rendering all questions, on next click render score via Status's renderScore method,
get top 3 scoreboard, add current score, sort array and push top 3 back to the localStorage
